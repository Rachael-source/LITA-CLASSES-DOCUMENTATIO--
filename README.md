## BASICS OF DATA ANALYSIS: DATA LITERACY
Data literacy is the state of putting data together in order to make meaning out of it. There are basic things to cosider in data literacy, they are; 
1. Data Generation
2. Data Storage
3. Data Structure
4. Data Analysis
5. Statistic
6. Data Driven Decision Making

### DATA GENERATION
This is the process of creating synthetic data for various purpose. It is the step by step processes to gather data. How you generate your data deterimine how much meaning you make out of it. 
Data set is the collection of data points which means attributes of data set. E.g Name, Gender, Location, Amount etc.
Note: The way we handle data generation is depends on the value we get. At this level, the structure of the data is not a problem.

### DATA GENERATION TOOLS
  Every organisation must run two system. They are;
- Operational System: This is the method an organisation uses to run or operate its program
- Analytic System: This is the system an organization uses to monitor and evaluate the functions of the organisation. This system is built by Power Bi, Excel etc.
   
### TYPES OF DATA
1. Random data generation: This involves creating data randomly, often used or testing.
2. synthetic data generation: It involves creating realistic, artificially generated data.

### DATA STORAGE
  This is the processof capturing, storing and retaining data in accessigle and secure manner.
###  METHODS OF DATA STORAGE
  There are two typical ways of data storage. They are;
- On premises ( local disk) This is when data is secure within the four walls of the organisation and only accessable in the premises of the organisation. Except permision is granted for 
  it to be sent out.
- Cloud ( Google Cloud, Azure) This when data is saved and available of online, and can be accessible anywhere.

### DATA STRUCTURE
  There are three ways in which data can be presented. These are;
- Structured (which means in tabular form)
- Semi structured (which is in the format of JSON or SML)
  JSON (Jaba Script Object Nodation)
  SML (Extensive Makeup Language)
- Unstructured (These are data set inform of media files. E.g vedios, images etc
  Understand that data must be in a strutured format before it can be analysed. Therefore, when it is presented in either semi format or unstructure format, It must be transformed into 
  structured format using ETL before it can be analysed.
  ETL Means Extract, Transform and Load.
  Every single thing done to data to make it analysable is ETL. It could be adding of attribute, delect or any change done to it.
### ETL TOOLS
  - Power Query
  - Microsfot SQL Server Intergration Services
  - Oracle Data Intergrator.ETC

### DATA ANALYSIS 
  There are certain things to do to analyse data. There are;
  - Ingestion: This is the system of connecting to data sources to channel it into a target tool you want to use.
  - Transformation: This is the process of making changes to the data before analysis. E.g Add, Delete Attributes, delete cell, etc.
  - Modeling: This is the system of bring data to the point where it can communicate or interact to build a sing report.
  - Visualisation: This is the stage of bring data to the point of view and understanding people where they can make comments.
  - Analysis: This is the point of performing some arithimatics using mode, media, average etc. to make decisions.
  - presentation: This is a way of communicating data using charts or any other meaningful means.

## UNLOCKING THE OPPORTUNITY IN DATA ANALYSIS
  Data analysis literally means; inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling of data to discover useful information and make meaningful decision.

### STAGES OF ANTI INSIGHT OF ORGANISATION TO MAKE DECISIONS
  - Get data
  - Explore data
  - Prepare data
  - Analyse data
  - Present data

### ROLES OF DATA ANALYST
  - To help organisation to make decision
  - Understand customer behaviour
  - Improve operation
  - Predict future trends/challanges
  - Identifies new opportunities
  - Help to give better allocation of resources
  - Identifies factors contributing to customer churns and develop stratages to handle it.

### SKILLS REQUIRED FOR DATA ANALYSIS
  1. Python for data manipulation and analysis
  2. R. Language for statistical analysis
  3. SQL for query, update and manipulation of structured data
  4. Tableau for creating complex visualization
  5. Power BI for creating interative reports and dashboard

### CARRIER IN DATA ANALYSIS
  - Data Scientist: AI Engineers
  - Data Engineers: they design and manage systems for collecting, storing and analyses data
  - Business Analyst
  - Data-Based Administrator

## INTRODUCTION TO EXCEL FUNCTIONS ( BASIC EXCEL FUNCTIONS)
  In exce, formulas and functions are used to perform calculations and manipulate data, but they differ in their purpose and syntax
### FORMULAS
  - A formula is an equation that calculates a value.
  - It starts with an equals sign (=)
  - Can contain numbers, operators, and cell references
  - Performs calculations, comparisons or logical operations
  -  It can be simple( e.g, = 2+2) or complex(e.g, =sum(A1:A10))
### FUNCTIONS
  - A function is a pre-built  formula that performs a specific task
  - It starts with an equals sign (=) followed by the function name
  - It takes arguments. Arguments in brankets are compulsory while in square branket are not compulsory
  - It can simplify complex calculations
  - Performs a specific calculation or operation( e.g, SUM, AVERAGE, IF)
