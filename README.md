## BASICS OF DATA ANALYSIS: DATA LITERACY
Data literacy is the state of putting data together in order to make meaning out of it. There are basic things to cosider in data literacy, they are; 
1. Data Generation
2. Data Storage
3. Data Structure
4. Data Analysis
5. Statistic
6. Data Driven Decision Making

### DATA GENERATION
This is the process of creating synthetic data for various purpose. It is the step by step processes to gather data. How you generate your data deterimine how much meaning you make out of it. 
Data set is the collection of data points which means attributes of data set. E.g Name, Gender, Location, Amount etc.
Note: The way we handle data generation is depends on the value we get. At this level, the structure of the data is not a problem.

### DATA GENERATION TOOLS
  Every organisation must run two system. They are;
- Operational System: This is the method an organisation uses to run or operate its program
- Analytic System: This is the system an organization uses to monitor and evaluate the functions of the organisation. This system is built by Power Bi, Excel etc.
   
### TYPES OF DATA
1. Random data generation: This involves creating data randomly, often used or testing.
2. synthetic data generation: It involves creating realistic, artificially generated data.

### DATA STORAGE
  This is the processof capturing, storing and retaining data in accessigle and secure manner.
###  METHODS DATA STORAGE
  There are two typical ways of data storage. They are;
- On premises ( local disk) This is when data is secure within the four walls of the organisation and only accessable in the premises of the organisation. Except permision is granted for 
  it to be sent out.
- Cloud ( Google Cloud, Azure) This when data is saved and available of online, and can be accessible anywhere.

### DATA STRUCTURE
  There are three ways in which data can be presented. These are;
- Structured (which means in tabular form)
- Semi structured (which is in the format of JSON or SML)
  JSON (Jaba Script Object Nodation)
  SML (Extensive Makeup Language)
- Unstructured (These are data set inform of media files. E.g vedios, images etc
  Understand that data must be in a strutured format before it can be analysed. Therefore, when it is presented in either semi format or unstructure format, It must be transformed into 
  structured format using ETL before it can be analysed.
  ETL Means Extract, Transform and Load.
  Every single thing done to data to make it analysable is ETL. It could be adding of attribute, delect or any change done to it.

 ### ETL TOOLS
  - Power Query
  - Microsfot SQL Server Intergration Services
  - Oracle Data Intergrator.ETC
