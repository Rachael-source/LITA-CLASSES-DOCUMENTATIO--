## BASICS OF DATA ANALYSIS: DATA LITERACY
Data literacy is the state of putting data together in order to make meaning out of it. There are basic things to cosider in data literacy, they are; 
1. Data Generation
2. Data Storage
3. Data Structure
4. Data Analysis
5. Statistic
6. Data Driven Decision Making

### DATA GENERATION
This is the process of creating synthetic data for various purpose. It is the step by step processes to gather data. How you generate your data deterimine how much meaning you make out of it. 
Data set is the collection of data points which means attributes of data set. E.g Name, Gender, Location, Amount etc.

- Operational System: This is the method an organisation uses to run or operate its program
- Analytic System: This is the system an organization uses to monitor and evaluate the functions of the organisation. This system is built by Power Bi, Excel etc.
   
### TYPES OF DATA
1. Random data generation: This involves creating data randomly, often used or testing.
2. synthetic data generation: It involves creating realistic, artificially generated data.

### DATA STORAGE
This is the processof capturing, storing and retaining data in accessigle and secure manner.
###  METHODS DATA STORAGE
There are two typical ways of data storage. They are;
- On premises ( local disk)
